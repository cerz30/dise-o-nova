Actions and Effects

All the Redux actions are available for you to handle through your middleware and reducers. For an example, refer to the Hyperpower reference plugin.

Side effects occur in two fundamental forms:

Some actions dispatch other actions based on state.
Some actions do async work by communicating over the RPC channel to the main process
In all cases, the side effect is passed as the effect key in the action and later handled by our middleware.

This means that you can override, compose or completely eliminate effects! In other words, this is how you can change the default functionality or behavior of the app.

As an example, consider the action we use to increase the font size when you press Command+=:
